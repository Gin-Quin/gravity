# Progressive web application

When the [persistence option]() is turned on, it is quite easy to turn an application using Gravity into a [progressive web application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction) that can work offline.

This is a simple example of how to implement a PWA with Gravity.

## Enable persistence

First, we need to enable persistence so that every query made with a Gravity store will be saved in a local IndexedDB database:

```ts
const { store } = defineApi<typeof services>({
  apiPath: "/api",
  network: "if-needed",
  persist: true,
})
```

Setting `network` to `"if-needed"` will prevent fetching data from the network if the data has previously been fetched.

Setting `persist` to `true` will save fetched data locally.


## Create a `stores.ts` file

Now, we will regroup all our stores (all the queries needed by the application) into a single file.

```ts
import { store } from "./api"

export const me = store.users.me()
export const scores = store.scores.all()
// ...
```

Regrouping all the stores in a single file has two advantages when working with a progressive web application:

- we just have to pass this file to the service worker for our application to be installed and ready to work offline,
- if it is the only place where Gravity's `store` is used, we are certain that every data will be correctly preloaded during the installation.

## Register the main service worker

Then we have to register the service worker that will **install** our application and 

```ts
if('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('./workers/pwa.js');
};
```

This will dispatch the `"install"` event from our service worker `./workers/pwa.js`.

## Preload data

Now during the installation process, we need to import all our stores.

```ts
self.addEventListener("install", event => {
  console.log("Start installation...")
  event.waitUntil(async () => {
    // loading the `stores.ts` file will preload
    // and persist all the data needed
    await import("../path/to/stores.js")
  })
})
```

## Preload static data

We can also preload static data like images using the [cache API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache):

```ts

self.addEventListener("install", event => {
  console.log("Start installation...")
  event.waitUntil(async () => {
    // loading the `stores.ts` file will preload
    // and persist all the data needed
    await import("../path/to/stores.js")
  })
})

async function preloadStaticData() {
  const cache = await caches.open("");
}
```
