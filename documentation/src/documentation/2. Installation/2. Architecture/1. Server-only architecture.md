As a back-end framework, Gravity can be used instead of Express, Fastify, Nest or other.

If not paired with a front-end counterpart you will lose Gravity's capacities to call server functions from the client, but you will still be able to generate a Rest api with the following advantages:

- **scalable** system (similar to Nest but without the boilerplate),
- **automatic parameters validation**,
- and an automatically generated `schema.json` file that **describes your api** and that your consumers can use to create their own sdk.

## Installation

1. Enter your project's directory (should be empty or almost empty)
3. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions

Once the installation is finished, you should have this project structure:

```
ðŸ“ƒ main.ts
ðŸ“ƒ schema.json
ðŸ“‚ services
    Service.ts
    Context.ts
    ðŸ“ƒ index.ts
    ðŸ“‚ service1
      ðŸ“ƒ index.ts
    ðŸ“‚ service2
    ...
```
