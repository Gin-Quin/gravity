Once Prisma is up and installed, you can create the `PrismaService` mixin:

```ts
// services/PrismaService.ts
import { Service } from './Service';
import { BasePrismaService } from '@digitak/gravity-prisma';

// we export the `PrismaService` mixin that extends `Service`
export const PrismaService = BasePrismaService(Service);
```

All the services that use Prisma will extend this mixin.

## Creating a Prisma service

Let's suppose we have the following prisma model `User`:

```prisma
model User {
  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  email    String    @unique
  name     String?
}
```

Then we can create a Gravity service that extends this model:

```ts
// services/user/index.ts
import { PrismaService } from '../PrismaService';

export class user extends PrismaService(prisma.user) {}
```

Now add the service to the `services` variable in `services/index.ts`...

...and your front have now access to all functions from the `user` model.

Like this:

```ts
await api.user.findMany({
  where: {
    name: "John",
  },
})
```

## Creating custom methods

A Prisma service is a service like any other, so you can add custom methods:

```ts
// services/user/index.ts
import { PrismaService } from '../PrismaService';
import type { User } from "@prisma/client"

export class user extends PrismaService(prisma.user) {
  async me(): User | undefined {
    if (!this.context.userId) return undefined

    return await this.findUnique({
      where: {
        id: this.context.userId
      }
    })
  }
}
```

## Access control

You can add **constraints** to your Prisma service.

These constraints will limit the data that the user who requested the data will be able to query and mutate. Constraints will likely depend on the **context**.

> Constraints work in a similar way to Postgres' [row level security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) but at server level rather than database level.

There are four properties that you can use to define constraints:

- `where` to add a condition that will apply to all queries and mutations,
- `selectable` to add a constraint on accessible fields,
- `includable` to add a constraint on includable relations,
- `select` to indicate which fields are selected by default,
- `include` to indicate which relations are included by default.

These properties are passed to your PrismaService definition:

```ts
// services/user/index.ts
import { PrismaService } from "../PrismaService";
import type { User } from "@prisma/client"

export class user extends PrismaService(prisma.user, context => ({
  where: {
    // only allow access to the current user and its friends
    id: {
      in: context.user ? [
        context.user.id,
        ...context.user.friends.map(friend => friend.id)
      ] : []
    }
  },
})) {}
```
