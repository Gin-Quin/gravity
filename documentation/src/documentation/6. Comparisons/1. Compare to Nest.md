[Nest](https://nestjs.com/) is a back-end Node framework that uses Typescript.

Gravity has a service architecture similar that looks like Nest's modules, but without all the boilerplate.

In comparison to Nest:

- Gravity is much more concise. Nest is known to have a lot of boilerplate code.
- Gravity does not create its own complicated module system with injectables like Nest does.
- Gravity uses EsBuild to compile Typescript when Nest uses Babel.
- Nest lays on top of Express or Fastify. Gravity can lay on top of a native Node server, but is also compatible with full-stack frameworks like SvelteKit and Next.
- Gravity has full-stack capacities thanks to its RPC system.
- When using Prisma, Gravity allows powerful declarative access to the database.
