[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) is another RPC framework similar to Gravity.

Like Gravity, **tRPC** is very well typed.

Advantages of tRPC over Gravity:

- It uses [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) to validate the client input types, so there is no need to generate a `schema.json` file like Gravity does.
- Thanks to **Zod**, it is possible to validate complex types like emails, phone numbers, strings with a minimum length, ...

Advantages of Gravity over tRPC:

- It does not use Zod, so defining server functions is much more concise.
- Thanks to its service architecture, Gravity scales better.
- When using Prisma, Gravity allows powerful declarative access to the database.
- Gravity is not only compatible with React but also with Svelte, SvelteKit and Solid.
