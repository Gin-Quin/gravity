# Prisma service

Once Prisma is up and installed, you can create the `PrismaService` mixin:

```ts
// services/PrismaService.ts
import { Service } from './Service';
import { BasePrismaService } from '@digitak/gravity-prisma';

// we export the `PrismaService` mixin that extends `Service`
export const PrismaService = BasePrismaService(Service);
```

All the services that use Prisma will extend this mixin.

## Creating a Prisma service

Let's suppose we have the following prisma model `User`:

```prisma
model User {
  id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  email    String    @unique
  name     String?
}
```

Then we can create a Gravity service that extends this model:

```ts
// services/user/index.ts
import { PrismaService } from '../PrismaService';

export class user extends PrismaService(prisma.user) {}
```

Now add the service to the `services` variable in `services/index.ts`...

...and your client can now call all functions from the `user` model:

```ts
await api.user.findMany({
	where: {
		name: 'John'
	}
});
```

Gravity created a **bridge** between your client and your ORM, making your ORM functions directly exposed to your client.

Since it is unsafe to expose freely CRUD methods to a client, we will learn later how to define [constraints](#constraints).

## Custom methods

A Prisma service is a service like any other, so you can freely add custom methods:

```ts
// services/user/index.ts
import { PrismaService } from '../PrismaService';
import type { User } from '@prisma/client';

export class user extends PrismaService(prisma.user) {
	async me() {
		const id = this.context.userId;
		if (!id) return undefined;

		return prisma.user.findUnique({
			where: { id }
		});
	}
}
```

## Constraints

You can add **constraints** to your Prisma services.

These constraints will limit the data that the user who requested the data will be able to query and mutate. Constraints can depend on a **context**.

> Constraints work in a similar way to Postgres' [row level security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) but at server level rather than database level.

There are four properties that you can use to define constraints:

- `where` to add a condition that will apply to all queries and mutations,
- `selectable` to add a constraint on accessible fields and relations (if not set, every field and relation can be queried),
- `select` to indicate which fields are selected by default,
- `include` to indicate which relations are included by default.

### Simple constraints

The following service extends the `user` model but only allow queries and mutations to apply to the user whose name starts with `"John"`:

```ts
// services/user/index.ts
import { PrismaService } from "../PrismaService";
import type { User } from "@prisma/client"

export class john extends PrismaService(prisma.user, {
  where: {
    // only match John, Johnny, Johnathan, ...
    name: {
      startsWith: "John",
    }
  },
})) {}
```

Then the client can easily fetch all Johns:

```ts
// this is client-side code
const { data: johns } = await api.john.findMany();
console.log(johns);
```

### Contextual constraints

Most of the time your constraints will be contextual and the access will depend on the user doing the request.

It is possible to pass a function to the constraints definition:

```ts
// services/user/index.ts
import { PrismaService } from '../PrismaService';
import type { User } from '@prisma/client';

export class user extends PrismaService(prisma.user, ({ context }) => ({
	where: {
		// only allow access to the current user and its friends
		id: {
			in: context.user ? [context.user.id, ...context.user.friends.map((friend) => friend.id)] : []
		}
	}
})) {}
```

With that setup, if we try to query all users from client side...

```ts
const { data: meAndFriends } = await api.user.findMany();

console.log(meAndFriends);
```

...we will only receive users related to the current user, which is: himself and his friends.

:::admonition type="tip"
The `where` constraint works for **READ** methods as well as **UPDATE** and **DELETE** methods. The current user won't be able to update any other random user data.

### Composing constraints

It is possible to define and reuse constraint definitions between services:

```ts
import type {
  PrismaConstraint,
  ContextualPrismaConstraint,
} from "@digitak/gravity-prisma"
import type { Service } from "./Service.js"

// a simple constraint
export const onlyJohns: PrismaConstraint<typeof Prisma.user> =
{
  where: {
    name: {
      startsWith: "John",
    }
  }
}

// a contextual constraint
export const onlyCurrentUserAndFriends: ContextualPrismaConstraint<
  typeof Prisma.user,
  Service,
> = ({ context }) => {
  where: {
    id: {
      in: context.user ? [
        context.user.id,
        ...context.user.friends.map(friend => friend.id)
      ] : []
    }
  },
}
```
