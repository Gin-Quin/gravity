# Gravity cli

Gravity comes with its own cli command: `gravity`.

All commands will look for the closest `gravity.toml` file to extract configuration options. These options can be overwritten by the cli parameters.

## gravity create

Setup a new Gravity project in the current working directory.

```coffee
gravity create [--manual] [--destination <path>]
```

- `--manual` add this option to indicate manually which frameworks you want your Gravity installation to work with.
- `--destination <path>` to start installation in another directory than the current working directory.

## gravity dev

Start a **dev server** with **hot reload**.

```coffee
gravity dev
  [--entry <file>]
  [--services <file>]
  [--schema <file>]
  [--use <command>]
```

- `--entry <file>` indicates the main file that starts your server (not compatible with `--use`).
- `--use <command>` when Gravity integrates with another back-end framework (like SvelteKit or Nuxt), this option indicates the framework's dev command (example: `svelte-kit dev`). Not compatible with `--entry`.
- `--services <file>` indicates the path of the source file that exports the `services` variable.
- `--schema <file>` is the path to the generated `schema.json` that describes your services's types.

:::admonition type="info"
This command will regenerate `schema.json` at start and then on every impacting change.

## gravity build

Build the Gravity server.

```coffee
gravity build
  [--entry <file>]
  [--output <file>]
  [--services <file>]
  [--schema <file>]
  [--use <command>]
```

- `--entry <file>` indicates the main file that starts your server (not compatible with `--use`).
- `--output <file>` the location of the output bundled file (not compatible with `--use`).
- `--use <command>` when Gravity integrates with another back-end framework (like SvelteKit or Nuxt), this option indicates the framework's build command (example: `svelte-kit build`). Not compatible with `--entry` and `--output`.
- `--services <file>` indicates the path of the source file that exports the `services` variable.
- `--schema <file>` is the path to the generated `schema.json` that describes your services's types.

## gravity preview

Start the Gravity server after a successful build.

```coffee
gravity preview [--output <file>]
```

- `--output <file>` the location of the output bundled file.

:::admonition type="warning"
If you integrated Gravity with another back-end framework, you should use the framework's preview command instead.
:::

## gravity generate schema

```coffee
gravity generate schema
  [--services <file>]
  [--schema <file>]
  [--watch]
  [--no-logs]
```

- `--services <file>` indicates the path of the source file that exports the `services` variable.
- `--schema <file>` is the path to the generated `schema.json` that describes your services's types.
- `--watch` set this option to wait for impacting changes and regenerate the schema.
- `--no-logs` set this option to prevent the command to output logs.
