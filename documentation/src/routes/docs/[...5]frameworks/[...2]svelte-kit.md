# SvelteKit

## Gravity handler

When using SvelteKit, you define your Gravity handler at `src/hooks.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineHandler } from '@digitak/gravity-svelte-kit/server';

import type { Context } from './services/Context';
import { services } from './services';
import schema from './schema.json';

export const { handle } = defineHandler({
	apiPath: '/api',
	services,
	schema, // set to "schemaless" if you don't want to use Gravity's built-in validator
	// additional options go there
});
```

Now every request made to `/api/...` will be caught by the handler and redirected to the right service.
