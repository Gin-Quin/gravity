# Configuration

You can configure your Gravity server at two levels:

- at your [server handler](/docs/project-structure/handler) for server-side configuration,
- at your [api definition](/docs/project-structure/api) for client-side configuration.

If you want to configure your **tooling** (generate schema, run dev server, build, ...), see the [configuration file](/docs/project-structure/configuration-file).

## Server handler configuration

```ts
function defineHandler<Services>(options: HandlerOptions<Services>);

type HandlerOptions<Services> = {
	services: Services;
	schema: Record<string, any>;
	apiPath: string = '/api';
	verbose?: boolean;
	allowedOrigins?: string[];
};
```

- `services` is the object that indexes all exported services,
- `schema` is the value of the schema generated from the types of your services,
- `apiPath` is the base path of your Gravity api,
- set `verbose` to `true` if you want full logs on errors,
- `allowedOrgins` is an array of urls that are allowed by the server.

You can also define your [server event](/docs/usage/events) callbacks here.

## Client api configuration

```ts
function defineApi<Services>(options: DefineApiOptions);

type DefineApiOptions = {
	apiPath: string = '/api';
};
```

- `apiPath` is the server url to fetch when requesting data:
  - in [full-stack application](/docs/getting-started/installation#applications), the server and the client share the same base url, so you can give it a value like `"/api"`,
  - in a [client application](/docs/getting-started/installation#applications), you have to give the full path to your server (in development mode it will most likely look like `"http://localhost:4000/api"`).

You can also define your [client events](/docs/usage/events) here.
