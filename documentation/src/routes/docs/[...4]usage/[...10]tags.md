# Tags

**Tags** are another type of decorators that mark a function or a whole service.

Tagging a function or a service has no effect, but it can be used in other places of the application.

The typical use case is to check at the [authorize](/docs/usage/events#_3-authorize) event if the target service or function is tagged, and allow access or not.

You create a tag with the `defineTag` function:

```ts
import { defineTag } from '@digitak/gravity';

function defineTag(symbolName?: string): [
  tag: (service: Service, path?: Array<string>) => any,
  isTag: (service: Service, path?: Array<string>) => any,
];
```

## Example

In this example, we will create a `Public` decorator that will mark functions and services that can be accessed without being authenticated.


```ts
// decorators/Public.ts
import { defineTag } from '@digitak/gravity';

export const [Public, isPublic] = defineTag();
```

Once a tag is defined, you can use it as a decorator at function-level:

```ts
import { Public } from "../../decorators/Public"

export class math extends Service {
  @Public
  add(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y
  }

  subtract(x: number, y: number): number {
    // always works
    return x - y
  }
}
```

Like guards, tags can also be applied at service-level:

```ts
@Public
export class math extends Service {
  // ...
}
```

## Authorizing with tags

We can now use our tag in the [authorize](/docs/usage/events#_3-authorize) callback.

```ts
import { isPublic } from "./decorators/Public"

export const handler = defineHandler<Context>({
  // ...

  authorize: ({ context, service, path: [property] }) => {
    // if the user is not authenticated and the service
    // property is not public, we throw an error
    if (!context.user && !isPublic(service, property)) {
      throw new ServerError('You must be authenticated to access the api')
    }
  },
})
```


## Difference between tags and guards

Tags and guards should not have the same roles:

- **guards** should be used to **restrain access**,
- **tags** should be used to **allow access**.

Indeed, since tags are used at the entry point of the request, if you **tag** a service as `'Admin'`:

- requests directly against a tagged will be authorized as expected,
- but calling a tagged function from another function will bypass the tag and so the admin check.

A guard does not have this security flaw: it will apply even when called from another function.
