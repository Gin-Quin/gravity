# Service endpoints

Grailty will automatically generate an endpoint for every public function or property inside a service.

Most of the time you won't use it because the `api` and the `store` proxy are a safer way to retrieve data from the server.

But you might want to create a REST api or want to test quickly one of your service methods by using an API platform like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [VsCode's Thunder client](https://www.thunderclient.com/).

Every service function or property is exposed at the following url:

```ts
`${baseApi}/${serviceName}/${target}`
```

### Example

Let's say we have our method `add` in our service `math`:

Then we can call our `add` method this way:

```typescript
import { api } from "/api"

const result = await api.math.add(1, 2)
```

This is *roughly* equivalent to doing so:

```typescript
const url = `localhost:3000/api/math/add`
const parameters = [1, 2]

const result = await fetch(url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type" : "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(parameters),
}).then(response => response.json())
```

*Roughly* equivalent because `api` does not use JSON to exchange data between server and client but [bunker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunker), a binary format much more compact that handles dates, maps, sets, regular expressions, big integers, recursive objects, ...

:::admonition type="tip"
If your server function returns an object referencing himself circularly, **JSON** will throw an error when **bunker** will succeed.

Also, dates will be stringified when using **JSON**.
:::

Using **fetch with JSON** is **not the recommended way** to call Gravity functions, but you can use it to test quickly if your service works.

## Nested property url

Let's suppose we have this slightly different `math` service:

```typescript
import { Service } from "../Service"

export class math extends Service {
  operations = {
    // we use arrow functions to keep the reference to `this`
    add: (x: number, y: number) => x + y,
    subtract: (x: number, y: number) => x - y,
  }
}
```

Then we can call `fetch` on this url:

```typescript
const url = `localhost:3000/api/math/operations/add`
```
