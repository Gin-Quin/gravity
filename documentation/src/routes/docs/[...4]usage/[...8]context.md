# Context

The **context** represents metadata that comes with a request. After a fresh Gravity installation, your **Context** type will be `undefined`.

Usually, contexts are used to indicate which user initiated the request.

When you change your `Context` type, you have to:

1. modify it in the [/services/Context.ts](/documentation/usage/project-structure#/services/context.ts) file,
2. update (or define) the [onRequestReceive](/documentation/usage/events#onrequestreceive) event to make it return the right context type.

## Simple authentification example

In this example, the client will send a user id with every request. The id is sent as a cookie. The server will then interrogate the database (using Prisma) to try to find the user.

If the server cannot find the server, it will not authorize the request to continue.

> See this page to learn [how to use cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).
>
> Cookies are safer than localStorage as they cannot be read from a script that runs into the browser.

```ts
import type { User } from "@prisma/client"

export type Context = {
  user?: User
}
```

```ts
import { Context } from "./services/Context"
import { services } from "./services"
import schema from "./schema.json"
import { defineHandler, parseCookies } from "@digitak/gravity"

export const handler = defineHandler<Context>({
  services,
  schema,

  onRequestReceive: async ({ request, cookies }) => {
    const context: Context = {}

    if (typeof cookies.userId == 'string') {
      context.user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
        where: {
          id: cookies.userId,
        }
      })
    }

    return context
  },

  authorize: ({ context }) => {
    if (context.user) return

    throw new ServerError('unauthenticated', {
      status: 500,
      message: "You must be authenticated to access the api",
    })
  },
})
```

This example is too simplistic since it won't allow *any* request to pass unless authenticated... including authenticating requests!

Next chapter we will learn about [guards](/documentation/usage/guards), which are special decorators to authorize requests at function-level.
