# Events

A **request** trigger the following events:

1. `onRequestSend` *(client)* A request is sent by the client.
2. `onRequestReceive` *(server)* The request is received by the server.
3. `authorize` *(server)* The request is authorized or not.
4. `onResponseSend` *(server)* A response is sent by the server.
5. `onResponseReceive` *(client)* The response is received by the client.

<EventsSchema/>

## 1. onRequestSend

This event happens just before the client sends a new request.

The callback signature is:

```ts
export type OnRequestSend = (options: {
  request: RequestInit;
}) => MaybePromise<RequestInit | undefined>;
```

:::admonition type="tip"
The `RequestInit` type is a global DOM type also available in Node.

This event can be used to add custom headers to the request.

As as client event, you define the callback as a [defineApi](/docs/project-structure/api) option:

```ts
export const { api, store } = defineApi<services>({
  onRequestSend: ({ request }) => {
    request.headers.append('my-custom-header', 'foo')
    return request
  }
})
```


## 2. onRequestReceive 

This event happens when a request is received by the server.

It is at this point that the **context** of the request is created. Usually the callback of this event will read the different headers of the request and create the right context.

The callback signature is:

```ts
export type OnRequestReceive<Context, Request> = (options: {
  request: Request;
  cookies: Record<string, string>;
}) => MaybePromise<Context>;
```

:::admonition type="tip"
The [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/Request) type is a global DOM type also available in Node.
:::


As as server event, you define the callback in the [gravity handler](/docs/project-structure/handler):

```ts
export const { handler } = defineHandler({
  services,
  schema,

  onRequestReceive: ({ request, cookies }) => {
    // do stuff, like reading headers or cookies
    // and return a context object
    const context: Context = ...
    return context
  }
})
```

:::admonition type="info"
If your `Context` type is different than `undefined`, you **must** define a `onRequestReceive` callback that returns a context from a request.

If you forget to define onRequestReceive, you will get a type error.
:::


## 3. authorize

Once a request is received and its context is created, you can decide to authorize or not its resolution via this event.

The callback signature is:

```ts
type Authorize<Context> = (parameters: {
  context: Context;
  service: ServiceConstructor;
  path: string[];
}) => unknown;
```

If you don't want a request to be authorized, throw an error inside the callback.

As as server event, you define the callback in the [gravity handler](/docs/project-structure/handler):

```ts
import { ServerError } from "@digitak/gravity"

export const { handler } = defineHandler({
  services,
  schema,

  authorize: ({ context, service, path }) => {
    if (service == services.math) {
      throw new ServerError("You are not authorized to access this top-secret service.")
    }
  }
})
```

## 4. onResponseSend

This callback happens just before the server send a response the client.

The callback signature is:

```ts
export type OnResponseSend<Context, Response> = (options: {
  context: Context;
  response: Response;
}) => MaybePromise<Response | undefined>;
```

As as server event, you define the callback in the [gravity handler](/docs/project-structure/handler):

```ts
import { ServerError } from "@digitak/gravity"

export const { handler } = defineHandler({
  services,
  schema,

  onResponseSend: ({ response }) => {
    console.log("Sending response", response)
  }
})
```

## 5. onResponseReceive

This event happens when the client receives a response from the server.


The callback signature is:

```ts
export type OnResponseReceive = (
  options: {
    response: Response;
  } & ApiResponse<unknown>,
) => unknown;
```

:::admonition type="tip"
The [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) type is a global DOM type also available in Node.
:::


A typical use case of this event is to handle errors.

As as client event, you define the callback as a [defineApi](/docs/project-structure/api) option:

```ts
export const { api, store } = defineApi<services>({
  onResponseReceive: ({ response, data, error }) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error("Could not resolve the request:", error)
    } else {
      console.log("Resolved request with data:", data)
    }
  }
})
```
