# Custom content type

Sometimes, you want to customize the type of the content of an endpoint's response.

This typically happens when you need to let your users download a file. You don't want to return a JSON (or Bunker) value containing the file data, you want to return the raw data itself.

This can be done easily with the `@ContentType` decorator.

```ts
import { ContentType } from "@digitak/gravity"

export class download extends Service {
  @ContentType("application/pdf")
  pdf() {
    const myPdfData: ArrayBuffer = /* ... get your data ... */
    return myPdfData;
  }
}
```

You will then be able to download properly your pdf when visiting `${YOUR_API_ROOT}/download/pdf`.
