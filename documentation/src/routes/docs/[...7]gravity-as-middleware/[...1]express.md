# Express integration

Gravity can be integrated as a **middleware** to any Express-like node server.

This can be useful:

- if you want to use Gravity as an extra layer to your back-end framework,
- if you already have an existing codebase and want to progressively switch to Gravity.

The middleware is accessible in `@digitak/gravity/middleware` subpackage:

```ts
import express from "express"
import { defineHandler } from "@digitak/gravity/middleware"
import { services } from "./services"
import schema from "./schema.json"

const app = express()

const gravity = defineHandler({
  // only handle api calls prefixed with "/gravity"
  apiPath: "/gravity",
  services,
  schema,
})

app.use(gravity)

app.listen(3000)
```

:::admonition type="tip"
Remember that since you are using Gravity, **Typescript** is still required.

This middleware is compatible with:

- Express
- Polka
- h3
- Connect

And any other Express-like framework.
