# Typescript usage

Gravity parses your source code to find the types of your service functions. Once the types are parsed, they are used to validate any parameters passed to a request to make sure they match their Typescript type.

For this reason, Gravity **requires Typescript** and is **not compatible with plain Javascript**.

:::admonition type="tip"
Gravity uses [Typezer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typezer) to extract the types and perform the validation. **Typezer** is able to validate even advanced Typescript types like **generics** and **template literals**.

When necessary, Gravity uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to run and build Typescript.

## Allow decorators

Some Gravity features need the usage of [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html). For decorators to work, you need to allow them in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES5",
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

## Strict mode

It is highly encouraged to use strict mode along Typescript. Especially the `strictNullChecks` option which is part of the strict mode.

Without `strictNullChecks`, this kind of code won't throw an error at compilation but will likely fail at runtime:

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string
}

function findUser(name: string): User | null {
  return null
}

const user = findUser('me')

user.name // will throw an error at runtime
```

When `strictNullChecks` is turned on, your compiler won't allow that kind of dangerous code.
