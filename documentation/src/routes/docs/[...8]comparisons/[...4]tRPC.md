# Compare to tRPC

[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) is another RPC framework similar to Gravity.

Like Gravity, **tRPC** is very well typed.

Advantages of tRPC over Gravity:

- It uses validation libraries like [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) to validate the client input types, so there is no need to generate a `schema.json` file like Gravity does.

Advantages of Gravity over tRPC:

- It uses TypeScript types to generate validation behavior, so defining server functions may be more familiar.
- tRPC use **string identifiers** to define and access queries. Instead, Gravity define proxies to use that allow to define functions in **namespaces** that can be **infinitely nested**.
