# Compare to tRPC

[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) is another RPC framework similar to Gravity.

Like Gravity, **tRPC** is very well typed.

Differences between Gravity and tRPC:

- Gravity automatically checks the input parameters of a request against the Typescript types of the target function. This prevent the need to use Zod and makes a more **concise** and **familiar** code. This comes with the cost of generating one `schema.json` file.
- tRPC uses **string identifiers** to define and access queries. Instead, Gravity uses diverse **proxies**.
- tRPC exchange data between data and server using [Superjson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superjson) when Gravity uses [bunker](https://github.com/digital-loukoum/bunker), a very compact binary format.
- Gravity has a **service** architecture when tRPC has a **router** architecture.
- Gravity's control access can be done in a **declarative way** via decorators.
- tRPC has websocket/subscription support.
- tRPC has a powerful [request batching](https://trpc.io/docs/links) system to group consequent calls in one request.
