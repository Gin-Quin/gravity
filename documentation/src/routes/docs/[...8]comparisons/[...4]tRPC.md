# Compare to tRPC

[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) is another RPC framework similar to Gravity.

Like Gravity, **tRPC** is very well typed.

Advantages of tRPC over Gravity:

- It uses [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) to validate the client input types, so there is no need to generate a `schema.json` file like Gravity does.
- Thanks to **Zod**, it is possible to validate complex types like emails, phone numbers, strings with a minimum length.

Advantages of Gravity over tRPC:

- It does not use Zod, so defining server functions is **much more concise**.
- tRPC use **string identifiers** to define and access queries. This kind of flat system does not allow namespaces and make it hard to scale. Instead, Gravity define proxies very easy to use that allow to define functions in **namespaces** that can be **infinitely nested**.
- When using Prisma, Gravity allows **powerful declarative access** to the **database**.
- Gravity is not only compatible with React and Next but also **Svelte**, **SvelteKit**, **Solid**, **Vue** and **Nuxt**.
