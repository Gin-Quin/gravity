# Compare to GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an awesome **query language** and **schema definition language**.

GraphQL came as a better alternative to Rest. GraphQL by himself is an amazing language but its integrations can be complicated.

A GraphQL user can chose to write GraphQL code directly, at the cost of losing the type informations, or use a **code generator** to generate the right types for his queries and mutations.

Instead of using a query language, Gravity has a RPC approach. You don't do **queries** or **mutations**, instead you call **functions**.

GraphQL has the following advantages over Gravity:

- It can be used with multiple languages (Go, Rust, C#, ...) where Gravity is limited to Typescript.
- It is very efficient at querying specific fields. Gravity can do the same with Prisma, but the syntax is less elegant.

Gravity has the following advantages over GraphQL:

- No need to generate code from each `.graphql` file. Only one file is generated: `schema.json`.
- GraphQL does not have namespaces, which can lead to very long variable names. Gravity define proxies very easy to use that allow to call functions in **namespaces** that can be **infinitely nested**.
- It is sometimes necessary but complicated to define custom scalars with GraphQL (ex: for dates, big integers). Gravity handles all Javascript types natively.
