# Installation

Gravity has one installation command:

```coffee
npm init @digitak/gravity
```

The effect of this setup command will depend on the **current working directory**:

- if the cli detects the directory is a **Svelte**, **React** or **Solid** project, it will setup a **Gravity client** application,
- if the cli detects the directory is a **full-stack** project like **SvelteKit** or **Next**, it will setup a **Gravity full-stack** application,
- if the directory is **empty** or the cli cannot detect any front-end framework, the cli will setup a **Gravity server** installation.

The `npm init @digitak/gravity` command will:

1. Install `@digitak/gravity`.
2. Detect which front-end framework is used (if any).
3. If the cli detected a compatible front-end framework, it will install one of the following packages:
   - `@digitak/gravity-svelte`
   - `@digitak/gravity-svelte-kit`
   - `@digitak/gravity-react`
   - `@digitak/gravity-solid`
   - `@digitak/gravity-next`
   - `@digitak/gravity-vue`
   - `@digitak/gravity-nuxt`
4. Create the files needed by the Gravity server.
5. Add `schema.json` to `.gitignore`.
6. Add or patch the `dev` and `build` scripts of `package.json`.

## Applications

Gravity can integrate with three kinds of applications:

- a **server** application:
  - you setup a Gravity server on top of a vanilla Node server or another back-end framework,
- a **client** application:
  - you setup a client that can call an external Gravity server (most of the time, your server and your client will share one monorepository),
- a **full-stack** application:
  - you use a full-stack framework like SvelteKit, Nuxt or Next,
  - you integrate Gravity into your full-stack framework,
  - you define both a Gravity server and a client that have access to the server api in the same application.

:::admonition type="info"
If you have a separate **server** and **client**, it is necessary to run the Gravity installation command twice: once in the server directory and once in the client directory.

### Setup a server application

1. Enter your server project's directory (should be empty or almost empty)
2. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions

### Setup a client application

1. Create your client application with your front-end framework of choice (Svelte, SvelteKit, Solid, React, Vue, Next, ...)
2. Enter your client project's directory
3. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions

:::admonition type="tip"
If you use a full-stack framework like SvelteKit but **don't want to define a server**, when the cli prompts which framework you want to integrate Gravity with, select manually the front-end counterpart of your full-stack framework.

**Example:** you installed a fresh SvelteKit application for developping your client. Your api already exists on an external server so you don't need to define another one. Indicate to the cli that you **do not want to install Gravity for SvelteKit**, and when the cli then prompts which framework you want to install Gravity with, select **Svelte**.

### Setup a full-stack application

You use a full-stack framework like [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), [Next](https://nextjs.org) or [Nuxt](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) and want to integrate Gravity with. Those kinds of frameworks are called **full-stack** because you define your server as well as your client in **one application**.

It makes development and deployment simpler and is perfect for **serverless applications** or **edge functions**.

1. Create your application with your full-stack framework of choice (SvelteKit, Next or Nuxt)
2. Enter your application project's directory
3. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions
