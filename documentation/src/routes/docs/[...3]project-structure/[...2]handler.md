# Handler

The handler is the entry point of your server. Its role is to receive and handle incoming client requests.


:::admonition type="tip"
You are not concerned by this file if you use Gravity client-side only.

:::admonition type="note"
If you are integrating **Gravity** with a back-end framework like **SvelteKit** or **Nuxt**, read the specific usage and location of your handler file:

- define Gravity handler with [SvelteKit](/docs/frameworks/svelte-kit),
- define Gravity handler with [Next](/docs/frameworks/next),
- define Gravity handler with [Nuxt](/docs/frameworks/nuxt).

### ðŸ“ƒ `src/index.ts`

This is the entry point of your server for the **server and client** and **server only** architectures.

The role of this file is to create a node server and pass as argument the gravity handler.

```typescript
import { createServer } from "http";
import { defineHandler } from "@digitak/gravity";

import type { Context } from './services/Context';
import { services } from "./services";
import schema from "./schema.json";

const PORT = 3000;

const { handler } = defineHandler({
  services,
  schema,
  // additional options go there
}),

const server = createServer(handler);

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Gravity server listening to port ${PORT} âœ¨`);
});
```

A Gravity server is very close to a vanilla node server, which allows for deep customization.
