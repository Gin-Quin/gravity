# Sample service

### ðŸ“ƒ `services/math/index.ts`

This is a sample service that comes with a fresh Gravity installation. You can delete it or do whatever you want with.

```typescript
import { Service } from '../Service';

export class math extends Service {
	add(x: number, y: number): number {
		return x + y;
	}

	subtract(x: number, y: number): number {
		return x - y;
	}
}
```

:::admonition type="note"
In Gravity, every service name must be uncapitalized. This is because `math` will never be instantiated manually, so it is closer to a variable than a constructor or a type.
:::

Here our service exposes two functions: `add` and `subtract`.

Later on, the client will be able to call them by using the `api` object proxy, like this:

```typescript
import { api } from '/api';

const result = await api.math.add(1, 2);
console.log(result); // { data: 3 }

const otherResult = await api.math.subtract(2, 1);
console.log(otherResult); // { data: 1 }
```

:::admonition type="tip"
Most of the time, querying api will be done at component-level with the `store` proxy.
