# Context

### ðŸ“ƒ `Context.ts`

This file exports the type of the `Context` object that will be passed at each request.

In particular, the `Context` object is used to tell who sent a request to the server and to perform access control and authorization.

After installation, this file content should be:

```typescript
export type Context = undefined;
```

A typical use case is to have a context like this:

```typescript
import { User } from '@prisma/client';

export type Context = {
	user?: User; // the user that sent a request
};
```
