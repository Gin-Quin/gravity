# Presentation

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is an excellent ORM that goes along very well with Gravity.

Gravity exports a **special Prisma service** that can extend a Prisma model. This eliminates the need to rewrite **CRUD** functions.

A raw exposition of your Prisma services is dangerous, so Gravity allows you to write your own access rules at service-level in a **declarative approach**.

:::admonition type="info"
It is possible to extend one Prisma model in different services - with different access rules.

## Installation

To install Prisma:

1. [Follow the instructions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) from the Prisma site.
2. Go to your server directory and run `npm install @digitak/gravity-prisma` to install the Gravity plugin.

:::admonition type="tip"
If you are using a **full-stack architecture** or a **server only architecture**, your server directory is your root directory.
