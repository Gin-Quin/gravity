# Architecture

Gravity can integrate with three types of architectures:

- a **server only** architecture:
  - you only need to setup a server and no client,
- a **server and client** architecture:
  - you have one main monorepository directory,
  - in this directory, you have one directory for your server and another for your client,
  - the client and the server are independent,
- a **full-stack** architecture:
  - you use a full-stack framework like SvelteKit or Next,
  - you want to integrate Gravity into your full-stack framework.

In a **server + client architecture**, it is necessary to run the installation command twice: first for the server, then for the client.

## Server only

As a back-end framework, Gravity can be used instead of Express, Fastify, Nest or other.

If not paired with a front-end counterpart you will lose Gravity's capacities to call server functions from the client, but you will still be able to generate a Rest api with the following advantages:

- **scalable** system (similar to Nest but without the boilerplate),
- **automatic parameters validation**,
- and an automatically generated `schema.json` file that **describes your api** and that your consumers can use to create their own sdk.

### Installation

1. Enter your project's directory (should be empty or almost empty)
2. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions

## Full-stack

In this architecture, you will use a full-stack framework like [SvelteKit](kit.svelte.dev), [Next](nextjs.org) or [Nuxt](v3.nuxtjs.org/).

These kind of frameworks are called **full-stack** because you define your server as well as your client in **one application**.

It makes development and deployment simpler and is perfect for **serverless applications**.

### Installation

1. Install your full-stack framework (SvelteKit, Next)
2. Enter the main directory of your application (if you are not already inside it)
3. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions

## Server and client

In this architecture, you will have a **monorepository** that contains at least two applications:

- the **server** (a Gravity application),
- and the **client** (a Svelte / SvelteKit / Solid / React / Next / Vue application).

The two applications are completely separated except for the **types that will be shared**.

:::admonition type="info"
When using a type defined in the server from the client, you will have to use the following syntax: `import type { MyType } from "path/to/MyType.ts"`.<br><br>Adding `type` after the keyword `import` will make sure that the import won't be resolved and that no server code will be loaded into the client.
:::

This architecture is a bit more complex to setup but is more flexible and powerful.

### Installation

1. Enter your monorepository directory
2. Create a new directory for your server: `mkdir server`
3. Enter your server directory: `cd server`
4. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions
5. Enter your monorepository directory again: `cd ..`
5. Install your client (Svelte, SvelteKit, React, Next, Solid) in the folder `client`
7. Make sure you are in your client application's directory
8. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions
