# Api

### ðŸ“ƒ `src/api.ts`

This file is your client's entry point to call a server function. It is the **bridge** between your server and your client.

:::admonition type="tip"
You are not concerned by this file if you use Gravity server-side only.
:::

```typescript
import type { services } from "./services"

// uncomment the right line depending on your front-end framework
import { defineApi } from "@digitak/gravity-svelte"
// import { defineApi } from "@digitak/gravity-solid"
// import { defineApi } from "@digitak/gravity-react"
// import { defineApi } from "@digitak/gravity-vue"

export const { api, useApi } = defineApi<services>({
  // additional options go there
})
```


:::admonition type="warning"
Don't forget to add the `type` keyword when importing your services!

Since this file is meant to be executed client-side, it should not bring any code from the server.
