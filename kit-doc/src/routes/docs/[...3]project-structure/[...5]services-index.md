# Services index

### ðŸ“ƒ `src/services/index.ts`

This file is the `index of your services`. It means every service that you want to expose to your client must be exported here in the `services` object.

After installation, this file content should be:

```typescript
import { math } from "./math" // sample service

export const services = {
  math, // we expose our "math" service to our client 
}
```

When creating more services, this file will grow:

```typescript
import { math } from "./math"
import { otherService1 } from "./otherService1"
import { otherService2 } from "./otherService2"

export const services = {
  math,
  otherService1,
  otherService2,
}
```

:::admonition type="info"
The `services` variable is be passed to the server entry point. When receiving a request, the server will then call the right function of the right service and send the response.

The `services` variable is also passed to the client `api` object but **only as a type**. Thanks to this trick, the `api` object will be well-typed without any server-side code being imported.
