# Handler

The handler is the entry point of your server. Its role is to receive and handle incoming client requests.


:::admonition type="tip"
You are not concerned by this file if you use Gravity client-side only.
:::

The location of Gravity's handler will depend if you are using a **full-stack architecture** or not. If so, you will have to use your framework-specific request handler.

## Vanilla Gravity server

### ðŸ“ƒ `src/index.ts`

This is the entry point of your server for the **server and client** and **server only** architectures.

The role of this file is to create a node server and pass as argument the gravity handler.

```typescript
import { createServer } from "http";
import { defineHandler } from "@digitak/gravity";

import type { Context } from './services/Context';
import { services } from "./services";
import schema from "./schema.json";

const PORT = 3000;

const handler = defineHandler<Context>({
  services,
  schema,
  // additional options go there
}),

const server = createServer(handler);

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Gravity server listening to port ${PORT} âœ¨`);
});
```

As you can see, it is very low-level and allows you to customize your node server as you wish.

## SvelteKit

### ðŸ“ƒ `src/hooks.ts`

When using Gravity as **full-stack architecture** with **SvelteKit**, your request handler is in `/src/hooks.ts`.

```typescript
import { defineHandler } from '@digitak/gravity-svelte';

import type { Context } from './services/Context';
import { services } from './services';
import schema from './schema.json';

export const handle = defineHandler<Context>({
  services,
  schema,
  // additional options go there
});
```
