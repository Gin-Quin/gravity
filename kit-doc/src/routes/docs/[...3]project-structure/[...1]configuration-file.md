# Configuration file

### ðŸ“ƒ `gravity.toml`

This is Gravity's configuration file. It is automatically created when running the installation command.

It can have any of the following options:

```ts
/**
 * Path of the entry file of Gravity's server
 */
entryFile?: string;

/**
 * Path of the output of the build
 */
outputFile?: string;

/**
 * Location of the file that exports the services
 */
servicesFile?: string;

/**
 * Directory or file where the schema is located
 * If a directory path is given, then Gravity will look for all parent 'node_modules' directories
 */
schemaFile?: string;

/**
 * Optional options to pass to esbuild when building the server
 */
esbuildOptions?: BuildOptions;
```

Check out the [esbuild api](https://esbuild.github.io/api/) for more information on `esbuildOptions`.
