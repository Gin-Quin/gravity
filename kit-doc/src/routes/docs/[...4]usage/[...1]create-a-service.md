# Create a service

A **service** is a **class** that defines functions that can be called from the client or any external source.

Services should not be instantiated manually unless there is a good reason. Gravity will automatically instantiate the needed services when a new request comes by.

Because each request will create a new service, it is a bad practice to do heavy tasks in the service constructor. Most of the time, no constructor is needed and your service will mostly act as a namespace for your functions.

Your services must extend the `Service` class that extends Gravity's `BaseService` class:

```typescript
export abstract class BaseService<Context = any> {
  public readonly context: Context

  // use this method to call another service from this service
  protected useService<Service extends BaseService<Context>>(
    serviceConstructor: new (context: Context) => Service,
  ): Service
}
```

A **service** is nothing too complicated:

- it contains a `context` property of type `Context`,
- and a method `useService` to call another service.

There can be one instance of each service maximum by request. If the same service is used multiple times by the same request, the first instance will be reused.

## Service examples

Let's create two services: `user` and `admin`.

```typescript
// /services/user/index.ts
export type User = {
  name: string
  isAdmin?: boolean
}

export const users: Array<User> = []

export class user extends Service {
  me(): User {
    return { name: "Foo" }
  }

  findByName(name: string): UserÂ | undefined {
    return users.find(user => user.name == name)
  }
}
```

```typescript
// /services/admin/index.ts
import { user } from "../user"

export class admin {
  amIAdmin(): boolean {
    return this.useService(user).me().isAdmin == true
  }
}
```

Once you created a new service, you have to add it to the `services` object so that the client can request it.

### External service getter

If you need to call another service too often, you might want to create a getter to access it more easily.

```typescript
// /services/admin/index.ts
import { user } from "../user"

export class admin {
  protected get user() {
    return this.useService(user)
  }

  amIAdmin(): boolean {
    return this.user.me().isAdmin == true
  }
}
```

:::admonition type="info"
We use the `protected` keyword to prevent `user` to be exposed to our clients.

We could also have prefixed it with `$` (see below).
:::


If this service is used globally by all your other services, you can add it to your base `Service` class:

```typescript
// /services/Service.ts
export class Service extends BaseService<Context> {
  protected get user() {
    return this.useService(user)
  }
}
```

## Unexposing service properties

There are five ways to prevent a service property to be exposed to your client:

1. by using the `private` keyword
2. by using the `protected` keyword
3. by prefixing the property name with a `#`
4. by prefixing the property name with a `$`
5. by prefixing the property name with a `_`

Using `private`, `protected` or prefixing with `#` will also make your property inaccessible from your other services.

## Exposing non-functions properties

In a Gravity service, not only functions are exposed to the client: every property will be queryable while it is not private, protected, or prefixed by a `$` or a `_`.

A non-function property can be accessed as **a function with no arguments**.

This means that if we add the `PI` constant to our  `math` service:

```ts
export class math extends Service {
  readonly PI = 3.14
}
```

Then our user can query it this way:

```ts
const { data: PI } = await api.math.PI()
```

:::admonition type="tip"
Be careful when you add functions and properties to your services. Remember that services are **exposed** by default.
:::


## Nested properties

A service can have object properties. It is possible to access specific sub-properties like one would expect:

```typescript
import { Service } from "../Service"

export class math extends Service {
  // we wrap our math functions inside "operations"
  operations = {
    // we use arrow functions to keep the reference to `this`
    add: (x: number, y: number) => x + y,
    subtract: (x: number, y: number) => x - y,
  }
}
```

Then you can use the `add` and `subtract` functions as expected:

```ts
const { data: sum } = await api.math.operations.add(4, 2)
console.log(sum) // will print 6

const { data: subtraction } = await api.math.operations.subtract(4, 2)
console.log(subtraction) // will print 2
```

### Querying a full object

In case you want to retrieve a whole object from one of your services and prevent user to access its properties, you can create a function that return the object:

```typescript
import { Service } from "../Service"

export class math extends Service {
  getConstants: () => this.constants,

  readonly constants = {
    PI: 3.14,
  } as const,
}
```
