You can customize your Gravity at two levels:

- at your [server handler](/documentation/usage/project-structure#server-handler) for server-side configuration,
- at your [api definition](/documentation/usage/project-structure#api.ts) for client-side configuration.

## Server handler configuration

```ts
function gravity<Context>(
  configuration: HandlerOptions
)

type HandlerOptions<Context> = {
  services: Record<string, Service>
  schema: Record<string, any>
  apiPath: string = "/api"
  verbose?: boolean
  allowedOrigins?: string[]
}
```

- `services` is the object that indexes all exported services,
- `schema` is the value of the schema generated from the types of your services,
- `apiPath` is the base path of your Gravity api,
- set `verbose` to `true` if you want full logs on errors,
- `allowedOrgins` is an array of urls that are allowed by the server.

You can also define your [server event](/documentation/usage/events) callbacks here.

## Client api configuration

```ts
function defineApi<Services>(
  options: DefineApiOptions
)

type DefineApiOptions = {
  apiPath: string = "/api"
};
```

- `apiPath` is the server url to fetch when requesting data:
  - in **full-stack architecture**, the server and the client share the same base url, so you can give it a value like `"/api"`,
  - in **server + client architecture**, you have to give the full path to your server (in development mode it will most likely look like `"http://localhost:4000/api"`).

You can also define your [client event](/documentation/usage/events) callbacks here.
