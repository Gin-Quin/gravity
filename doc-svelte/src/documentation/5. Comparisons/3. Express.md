Gravity has the following advantages over Express:

- Gravity has automatic parameters validation so there is no risk that a bug is induced by a wrong user input type.
- Gravity is compatible with full-stack frameworks SvelteKit and Next.
- Gravity proposes a type-safe way to communicate with the client.
- If needed, Gravity's main package exports a middleware that can be used by Express. You can add your Gravity server on top of an Express server.
