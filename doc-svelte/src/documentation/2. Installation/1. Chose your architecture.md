Before installing Gravity, you must decide how your project will be architectured.

There are three possible architectures with Gravity:

- a **client + server** architecture,
- a **full-stack** architecture,
- or a **server-only** architecture.

## Client + server architecture

In this architecture, you will have a **monorepository** that contains at least two applications:

- the **server** (a Gravity application),
- and the **client** (a Svelte / SvelteKit / Solid / React / Next / Vue application).

The two applications are completely separated except for the **types that will be shared**.

> When using a type defined in the server from the client, you will have to use the following syntax: `import type { MyType } from "path/to/MyType.ts"`.<br><br>Adding `type` after the keyword `import` will make sure that the import won't be resolved and that no server code will be loaded into the client.

This architecture is a bit more complex to setup but is more flexible and powerful.

Using the **client + server architecture** with Gravity, you will have this monorepository structure:

```
ğŸ“‚ server
  ğŸ“ƒ main.ts
  ğŸ“ƒ schema.json
  ğŸ“‚ services
      ğŸ“ƒ index.ts
      ğŸ“‚ service1
        ğŸ“ƒ index.ts
      ğŸ“‚ service2
      ğŸ“‚ ...

ğŸ“‚ client
  ğŸ“‚ src
    ğŸ“ƒ api.ts
  ... other files depending on your front-end framework
```


## Full-stack architecture

In this architecture, you will use a full-stack framework like [SvelteKit](kit.svelte.dev), [Next](nextjs.org) or [Nuxt](v3.nuxtjs.org/).

These kind of frameworks are called **full-stack** because you define your server as well as your client in **one application**.

It makes development and deployment simpler and is perfect for **serverless applications**.

Using the **full-stack architecture** with Gravity, you will have this file structure:

```
ğŸ“‚ src
  ğŸ“ƒ api.ts
  ğŸ“ƒ schema.json
  ğŸ“‚ services
    ğŸ“ƒ index.ts
    ğŸ“‚ service1
      ğŸ“ƒ index.ts
    ğŸ“‚ service2
    ğŸ“‚ ...
... other files depending on your framework
```

## Server-only architecture

As a back-end framework, Gravity can be used instead of Express, Fastify, Nest or other.

If not paired with a front-end counterpart you will lose Gravity's capacities to call server functions from the client, but you will still be able to generate a Rest api with the following advantages:

- **scalable** system (similar to Nest but without the boilerplate),
- **automatic parameters validation**,
- and an automatically generated `schema.json` file that **describes your api** and that your consumers can use to create their own sdk.

Using the **server-only architecture** with Gravity, you will have this file structure:


```
ğŸ“ƒ main.ts
ğŸ“ƒ schema.json
ğŸ“‚ services
    ğŸ“ƒ index.ts
    ğŸ“‚ service1
      ğŸ“ƒ index.ts
    ğŸ“‚ service2
    ğŸ“‚ ...
```
