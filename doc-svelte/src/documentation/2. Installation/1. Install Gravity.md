Gravity has one installation command:

```coffee
npm init @digitak/gravity
```

The effect of this setup command will depend on the **current working directory**:

- if the cli detects the directory is a **Svelte**, **React** or **Solid** project, it will setup a **Gravity's client** installation,
- if the cli detects the directory is a **full-stack** project like **SvelteKit** or **Next**, you will be asked what kind of installation you wish:
  - a **Gravity's client** installation for [server + client](/documentation/installation/chose-your-architecture#server-+-client-architecture) architecture,
  - or a **Gravity's full-stack** installation for [full-stack](/documentation/installation/chose-your-architecture#full-stack-architecture) architecture,
- if the directory is **empty** or the cli cannot detect any front-end framework, the cli will setup a fresh **gravity server** installation.


Installation process will depend on the architecture of your project.

## Architectures

Gravity can integrate with three types of architectures:

- a **server-only** architecture:
  - you only need to setup a server and no client,
- a **server + client** architecture:
  - you have one main monorepository directory,
  - in this directory, you have one directory for your server and another for your client,
  - the client and the server are independent,
- or a **full-stack** architecture:
  - you use a full-stack framework like SvelteKit or Next,
  - you want to integrate Gravity into your full-stack framework.

> In a **server + client architecture**, it is necessary to run the installation command twice: first for the server, then for the client.
