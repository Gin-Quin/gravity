In this architecture, you will have a **monorepository** that contains at least two applications:

- the **server** (a Gravity application),
- and the **client** (a Svelte / SvelteKit / Solid / React / Next / Vue application).

The two applications are completely separated except for the **types that will be shared**.

> When using a type defined in the server from the client, you will have to use the following syntax: `import type { MyType } from "path/to/MyType.ts"`.<br><br>Adding `type` after the keyword `import` will make sure that the import won't be resolved and that no server code will be loaded into the client.

This architecture is a bit more complex to setup but is more flexible and powerful.

## Installation

1. Enter your monorepository directory
2. Create a new directory for your server: `mkdir server`
3. Enter your server directory: `cd server`
3. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions
6. Enter your monorepository directory again: `cd ..`
7. Install your client (Svelte, SvelteKit, React, Next, Solid) in the folder `client`
8. Make sure you are in your client application's directory
3. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions

Once the installation is finished, you should have this project structure:

```
ğŸ“‚ server
  ğŸ“ƒ main.ts
  ğŸ“ƒ schema.json
  ğŸ“‚ services
      ğŸ“ƒ index.ts
      ğŸ“‚ service1
        ğŸ“ƒ index.ts
      ğŸ“‚ service2
      ğŸ“‚ ...

ğŸ“‚ client
  ğŸ“‚ src
    ğŸ“ƒ api.ts
  ... other files depending on your front-end framework
```
