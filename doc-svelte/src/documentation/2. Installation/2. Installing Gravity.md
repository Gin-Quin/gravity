Once you have [chosen your architecture](/documentation/installation/chose-your-architecture), you have two steps left to do:

1. Install your **front-end** or **full-stack framework** if you are going to use one,
2. Go into your root directory, run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions.

The cli command will guide you through the setup of the project and generate all necessary files for you.

> If you are using a **client + server architecture**, the **root directory** is your monorepository directory.
