Gravity parses your source code to find the types of your service functions. Once the types are parsed, they are used to validate any parameters passed to a request to make sure they match their Typescript type.

For example, let's suppose we have the function `add` in the service `math`:

```typescript
function add(x: number, y: number): number
```

Then any request to this function that does not provides two integers as parameters will return an error.

```ts
await api.math.add(1, "2") // this call will fail
```

For this reason, Gravity **requires Typescript** and is **not compatible with plain Javascript**.

> Gravity uses [Typezer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typezer) to extract the types and perform the validation. **Typezer** is able to validate even advanced Typescript types like **generics** and **template literals**.


## Strict mode

It is highly encouraged to use strict mode along Typescript. Especially the `strictNullChecks` option which is part of the strict mode.

Without `strictNullChecks`, this kind of code won't throw an error at compilation but will likely fail at runtime:

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string
}

function findUser(name: string): User | null {
  return null
}

const user = findUser('me')

user.name // will throw an error at runtime
```

When `strictNullChecks` is turned on, your compiler will warn you that you are writing dangerous code.
