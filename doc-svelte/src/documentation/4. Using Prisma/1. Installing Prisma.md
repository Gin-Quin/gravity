[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is an excellent ORM that goes along very well with Gravity.

You will learn how to expose your prisma models directly to your client in a safe and authorized way.

To install Prisma:

1. [Follow the instructions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) from the Prisma site.
2. Go to your server directory and run `npm install @digitak/gravity-prisma` to install the Gravity plugin.

> If you are using a **full-stack architecture** or a **server-only architecture**, your server directory is your root directory.
